# Enhanced CentralBrain Agent - Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced Tools AI Agent Node Type Fixed

**Problem**: Node was using deprecated `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` type
**Solution**: Updated to modern `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolsAgent` with proper configuration

**Changes Made**:

- Changed node type from `agent` to `toolsAgent`
- Added proper prompt configuration with system message
- Maintained existing AI connections (language model and memory)

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Command Router Connection Restored

**Problem**: Enhanced Tools AI Agent was disconnected from Enhanced Command Router
**Solution**: Added missing connection as 5th output of the switch node

**Changes Made**:

- Added new connection branch for "general" command type
- Enhanced Tools AI Agent now receives general queries that don't match specific command types

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Logging Node Values Configured

**Problem**: "Values to Send" were not configured in the PostgreSQL logging node
**Solution**: Mapped all required database fields with proper expressions

**Configured Fields**:

- `user_id`: User identifier from request
- `session_id`: Session identifier for tracking
- `command`: Original chat input/command
- `command_type`: Detected command type (freqtrade, docs, market, etc.)
- `success`: Boolean indicating if request was successful
- `response_data`: Complete response object
- `error_data`: Error information if any
- `execution_time_ms`: Processing time calculation

### 4. ‚úÖ OpenAI Chat Model Configured for OpenRouter

**Problem**: OpenAI node needed credentials but we're using OpenRouter
**Solution**: Configured OpenAI node to work with OpenRouter API

**Configuration**:

- Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- Base URL: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- Credential: OpenRouter API key (configured as OpenAI credential type)

## Remaining Issues & Next Steps

### üîÑ OpenRouter Credential Setup Required

You need to create an OpenAI-type credential in n8n using your OpenRouter API key:

1. Go to n8n Settings ‚Üí Credentials
2. Click "Create New Credential"
3. Select "OpenAI"
4. Enter your OpenRouter API key in the "API Key" field
5. Leave "Organization ID" blank
6. Name it "OpenRouter account"
7. Save the credential

### üìù Documentation Search API - Basic Auth Expected

**Status**: Noted for future resolution
**Issue**: Missing Basic Auth credential for Freqtrade API
**Reason**: Freqtrade container not built yet
**Next Step**: Configure when Freqtrade container is deployed

## Technical Details

### Node Type Migration

```json
// Before (Deprecated)
"type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent"

// After (Current)
"type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolsAgent"
```

### OpenRouter Integration

The OpenAI Chat Model node can work with OpenRouter by:

- Setting `baseURL` to OpenRouter's API endpoint
- Using OpenRouter model names (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
- Using OpenRouter API key as OpenAI credential

### Database Schema Mapping

The Enhanced Logging node now properly maps to the `centralbrain_logs` table with all required fields populated from the workflow execution context.

## Validation Results

- ‚úÖ JSON structure validated successfully
- ‚úÖ All node connections verified
- ‚úÖ Required parameters configured
- ‚úÖ Workflow ready for import and testing

## Import Instructions

1. Copy the updated JSON from `enhanced_centralbrain_agent.json`
2. Import into n8n via UI (Workflows ‚Üí Import from JSON)
3. Configure OpenRouter credential as described above
4. Test workflow with sample requests
5. Activate workflow once testing is complete

## Testing Recommendations

Test each command type:

- `freqtrade:status` - Should hit Freqtrade API (when available)
- `docs:search term` - Should search documentation
- `market:BTC` - Should get market analysis
- `notification:test message` - Should send notification
- General queries - Should be processed by AI agent
