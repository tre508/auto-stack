## Appendix: Real-World Freqtrade/FreqAI Strategy Research

**(This section was merged from the legacy `RL_RagsToRiches_Plan.md` document)**

**Objective:** Identify and summarize real-world, proven profitable Freqtrade/FreqAI strategies, with a focus on Kraken Exchange and FreqAI integration. This section serves as a foundation for a practical implementation playbook.

### Key Findings & Resources

- **Case Study: 2509% Profit with Freqtrade**  
  [2509% Profit Unlocked: A Case Study on Algorithmic Trading with Freqtrade](https://imbuedeskpicasso.medium.com/2509-profit-unlocked-a-case-study-on-algorithmic-trading-with-freqtrade-39b1051c0f1e)  
  - Used on Binance, but principles apply to Kraken.  
  - Key indicators: EMA (8/21, "Slope is Dope"), RSI, ADX, Volume.  
  - Emphasizes robust backtesting, forward testing, and risk controls (max open trades, stoploss, trailing stop).
  - Highlights: 2509% ROI over 762 days, 3.16% max drawdown, 25 trades/day, 3.29% avg daily profit.
  - Tips: Use multiple timeframes, optimize with Hyperopt, monitor win/loss ratio, drawdown, and adapt to market regimes.

- **FreqAI Community Strategies**
  - [kyrypto/kdog-freqai-strats (archived)](https://github.com/kyrypto/kdog-freqai-strats): Example FreqAI strategies, including RL and feature engineering templates.
  - [nateemma/strategies](https://github.com/nateemma/strategies): Large collection of Freqtrade strategies (PCA, NN, anomaly detection, DWT, etc.), with detailed notes on backtesting, hyperopt, and live trading best practices.

- **Kraken Exchange Integration**
  - [Beginner's Guide: Automated Trading with Kraken & Freqtrade](https://ashulzhenko.medium.com/cryptocurrency-automatic-trading-with-kraken-exchange-for-beginners-b0ee8c514944): Step-by-step setup, API keys, config, and dry-run/live trading.
  - Key config: Use static pairlists, ensure API permissions, and always start with dry-run mode.

### Common Patterns in Profitable Strategies
- **Indicators:**
  - EMA crossovers ("Slope is Dope"), RSI, ADX, Volume spikes, regime/context features.
  - Multi-timeframe features and normalization (z-score, min-max).
- **Risk Management:**
  - Max open trades, dynamic position sizing, conservative stoploss, trailing stop.
- **Backtesting & Forward Testing:**
  - Extensive backtesting on diverse timeranges and market conditions.
  - Forward test in dry-run for at least 2 months before live deployment.
- **Hyperopt:**
  - Focus on entry/exit thresholds, ROI, stoploss, and trailing parameters.
  - Use custom loss functions (Sharpe, Sortino, Expectancy) for robust optimization.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Add regime/context awareness, volatility, trend, and volume features.
  - Use informative pairs and multiple timeframes for richer state information.
- **RL/FreqAI Specifics:**
  - Custom reward functions are essentialâ€”penalize drawdown, reward compounding returns.
  - Regular retraining and monitoring for regime changes.
  - Seed everything for reproducibility.

### Implementation Notes
- Start with proven indicator sets (EMA, RSI, ADX, Volume) and robust risk controls.
- Use static pairlists and ensure sufficient historical data for both training and backtesting.
- Integrate FreqAI with a focus on feature/target alignment and custom reward shaping.
- Monitor performance metrics (winrate, drawdown, CAGR, Sharpe/Sortino) and iterate.
- Reference public repos for code templates and advanced feature engineering.
