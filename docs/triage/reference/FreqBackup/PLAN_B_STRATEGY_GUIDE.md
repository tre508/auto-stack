# Plan B Strategy Guide for Auto-Stack Integration

## Overview
This guide consolidates the lessons learned from our previous RL experimentation and outlines a robust, data-driven approach for developing trading strategies within the auto-stack ecosystem. The focus is on building reliable, maintainable strategies that leverage proven technical indicators and machine learning techniques.

## Core Principles

### 1. Data-Driven Development
- Start with extensive backtesting using historical data
- Use FreqAI's built-in data processing capabilities
- Implement proper train/test splits (80/20 recommended)
- Validate strategy performance across multiple market conditions

### 2. Risk Management
- Implement strict stop-loss mechanisms
- Use position sizing based on volatility
- Maintain a maximum of 5 open trades
- Set conservative profit targets
- Use trailing stops for trend following

### 3. Technical Indicators
Primary indicators to consider:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Bollinger Bands
- Volume indicators
- Support/Resistance levels

### 4. Machine Learning Integration
- Use FreqAI's feature engineering capabilities
- Focus on supervised learning approaches
- Implement proper cross-validation
- Monitor for overfitting
- Use ensemble methods when appropriate

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables
FREQTRADE_API_USERNAME=your_api_user
FREQTRADE_API_PASSWORD=a_very_secure_password
KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_kraken_key
KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_kraken_secret
API_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_WS_TOKEN=your_ws_token
```

### 2. Strategy Development Workflow
1. Start with a basic strategy template
2. Add technical indicators
3. Implement entry/exit logic
4. Backtest thoroughly
5. Optimize parameters
6. Deploy to paper trading
7. Monitor performance
8. Iterate based on results

### 3. FreqAI Model Development
1. Create a new model class extending `IFreqaiModel`
2. Implement feature engineering
3. Define training parameters
4. Set up prediction logic
5. Implement proper data preprocessing

### 4. Integration with Auto-Stack
1. Ensure API server is enabled in config
2. Set up proper authentication
3. Configure logging to work with agent_logs
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Set up monitoring and alerts

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep strategies modular and well-documented
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for critical components

### Performance Monitoring
- Track key metrics:
  - Win rate
  - Profit factor
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Risk-adjusted returns
- Set up automated alerts for:
  - Unusual losses
  - System errors
  - Performance degradation

### Security
- Never hardcode credentials
- Use environment variables
- Implement proper API authentication
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. API Connection Problems
   - Check credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check API rate limits

2. Strategy Performance Issues
   - Review backtest results
   - Check for overfitting
   - Verify indicator calculations
   - Monitor market conditions

3. FreqAI Model Issues
   - Check data quality
   - Verify feature engineering
   - Monitor model performance
   - Check for memory leaks

## Next Steps

1. Review and adapt existing strategies from `strategies - Copy`
2. Evaluate and update models from `models - Copy`
3. Set up proper logging and monitoring
4. Implement automated testing
5. Create deployment pipeline
