# HAR Debugging Notes for Freq-Chat LLM Streaming

**Date:** 2025-05-31

**Issue:** Main chat streaming in `freq-chat` is not displaying responses in the UI, although the `/api/chat` endpoint returns a 200 OK.

**HAR File Status:**
- The raw `docs/reference/localhost.har` file was not found when attempting to read it directly.
- An existing analysis is available in `docs/services/freq-chat/har-file-ananysis.md`.

**Summary from `har-file-ananysis.md`:**
- The analysis focuses on general frontend performance, large JS bundles, and Time To First Byte (TTFB) for various endpoints.
- `/api/chat` (first call) had a TTFB of ~3.44s. Subsequent calls were ~0.4s.
- The analysis did not provide specific details about the `Content-Type` of the `/api/chat` response or the presence/absence of SSE chunks in the response body, which are needed to diagnose the streaming issue at the network level.

**Conclusion for HAR Analysis Step:**
Due to the unavailability of the raw HAR file for detailed inspection of the `/api/chat` response stream, I cannot definitively confirm if a valid `text/event-stream` with SSE chunks is being returned from the backend. However, based on the symptoms (UI not updating despite 200 OK and proxy logs showing activity), the issue likely lies in the stream generation by the Vercel AI SDK's `openai` provider or its handling.

**Next Action:**
Proceeding with the plan to refactor `freq-chat/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` to use a direct `fetch` call for streaming, bypassing the potentially problematic SDK provider behavior for streaming with a custom `baseURL`.
