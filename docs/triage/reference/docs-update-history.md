# üóÇÔ∏è Docs Update Plan

**FINAL STATUS (as of 2025-05-13):**

- The stack now uses **Mem0** (with ChromaDB as vector store), **OpenRouter** (Gemini LLM), and **HuggingFace all-mpnet-base-v2** for embeddings.
- **OpenWebUI** and related docs/images have been fully removed.
- n8n, controller, and OpenRouter proxy are the main orchestrators.
- All legacy/obsolete files are marked for archival or have been replaced.
- Mem0 config is now loaded from file at runtime, supporting flexible backend swaps.
- The stack is fully open/free for both LLM and embeddings, with no paid API dependencies.
- See `config.yaml` and compose file for current architecture.

## ‚úÖ Review Categories

- ‚úÖ Still Valid: No changes needed except rephrasing or formatting
- ‚è≥ To Be Rebuilt: Structure stays but content needs modernization
- ‚ùå Obsolete Logic: Feature removed or tech deprecated, needs redesign

## üìÅ Root Docs

| File Name             | Status        | Notes / TODOs                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| README_agent.md       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked     | **NEEDS COMPLETE REWRITE.** Current version appears to have addressed removal of `.cursor` and old "host controller" references. Other TODOs remain: Update roles, new dir structure, new key files, new onboarding tasks, re-evaluate guiding rules & test instructions. **EDITING TOOL FAILED previously on larger updates.** Manual intervention likely required for full rewrite. |
| MasterSetup.md        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Archive & Replace | **MARKED FOR ARCHIVAL. DO NOT UPDATE FURTHER.** Contains extensive legacy context. Strategy is to replace with new, focused guides. Added prominent archival note to file. Original TODO: Major overhaul or break into smaller guides for current architecture. Refer to `README_agent.md` for current overview. |
| MasterSetup_Checklist.md | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated     | **MARKED FOR ARCHIVAL.** Based on outdated `MasterSetup.md`. Added archival note to file. New checklists should be developed for the current architecture if needed. Original TODO: Rebuild or deprecate. |
| AutomationChecklist.md | ‚úÖ Updated     | **CONTENT REBUILT.** File content appears largely up-to-date with current stack. Original TODOs for legacy refs seem addressed. Incremental updates are possible. Original status: `‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked` due to past full rewrite failures. |
| UserActionGuide.md    | ‚ùå Archived      | **MARKED FOR ARCHIVAL.** Almost entirely obsolete, tied to outdated `MasterSetup.md`. Added archival note to file. Original TODO: Archive or rewrite; decision is to archive. A new guide for the current stack may be needed separately. |
| TODO.md               | ‚úÖ Replaced    | **REPLACED.** Original file moved to `depreciated/` by user. Superseded by the new `automation-stack/docs/TODO.md` (which is based on `setup/MasterGameplan.md`) and the detailed guides in `automation-stack/docs/setup/`. Original status: `‚ö†Ô∏è Archive & Replace`. |
| INDEX.md              | ‚úÖ Rebuilt     | **REGENERATED & REPLACED.** New index created based on current `docs/` directory structure, excluding `OpenWebUI_Docs/`. Original status: `‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked`. |
| obsidian_service_docs.md | ‚úÖ Updated     | **UPDATED.** Rewritten to reflect current doc sharing via Docker volumes (`/automation-stack/docs/`, `/freqtrade/user_data/docs/`). Removed Optuna references. Clarified distinction between core project doc access and optional user-managed Obsidian integrations (e.g., `Remotely Save`, external git clones). Original TODOs addressed. |
| proxy.md              | ‚úÖ Updated     | **INTEGRATED & UPDATED.** Node.js OpenRouter proxy is now a containerized service (`openrouter_proxy_mcp`) in `compose-mcp.yml`. Document updated to reflect this, including setup via `.env`, Traefik routing, and usage as a managed service. Original TODOs addressed. |
| pipe_mcp.md           | ‚úÖ Updated     | **UPDATED.** Emphasized its advanced/optional nature and that it's not a baseline feature. Stated that inclusion of `mcpo`/MCP tools is a pending decision. Advised users to consult official `mcpo` docs for up-to-date setup information. Original TODOs addressed. |

## üìÅ Deprecated Docs (`automation-stack/docs/depreciated/`)

| Item                  | Status            | Notes / TODOs                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (All files within)    | ‚ùå Deprecated     | Files in this directory are explicitly deprecated. While they might contain salvageable code snippets or concepts from previous iterations, they should **not** be treated as relevant to the current architecture without thorough review and adaptation. Assume all instructions, configurations, and workflows described within are obsolete. |

## üß© Next Steps

1. As you update each file, prepend a `## Status:` section with one of the three categories
2. Keep original content intact‚Äîstrike through or annotate outdated parts instead of deleting
3. When all files are processed, mark this checklist complete and archive as `DocsUpdateHistory.md`
