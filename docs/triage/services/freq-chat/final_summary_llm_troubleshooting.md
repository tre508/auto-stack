# Freq-Chat LLM Connection - Final Summary & Next Steps (As of 2025-05-31)

This document provides a final summary of the extensive troubleshooting performed to connect Freq-Chat to the OpenRouter API via a local proxy (`openrouter_proxy_mcp`) and outlines the current status and recommended next steps.

## Initial Objective
Successfully route all LLM calls from Freq-Chat (both for chat title generation and main chat streaming) through the `openrouter_proxy_mcp` to OpenRouter.ai, using the specified OpenRouter API key and models like "tngtech/deepseek-r1t-chimera:free".

## Critical Breakthrough: Environment Variable Loading
-   **Core Problem Identified:** The Freq-Chat `pnpm dev` process, when launched from within certain integrated terminals (like Cursor's), was inheriting `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` from the shell environment. These inherited variables (often pointing to a Hugging Face token and the controller's Mem0 proxy URL, intended for other services) were overriding the correct values defined in `freq-chat/.env.development.local`.
-   **Solution:** Running `pnpm dev` for `freq-chat` in a **separate, clean terminal session** (e.g., a new PowerShell window outside of Cursor) where these global/shell overrides were not present.
-   **Outcome:** This allowed `freq-chat/.env.development.local` to be loaded correctly. Subsequent logs from `freq-chat/lib/ai/providers.ts` and `freq-chat/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` confirmed that `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` was correctly set to the OpenRouter key (`sk-or-v1-9dde...`) and `process.env.OPENAI_BASE_URL` was correctly set to the local proxy URL (`http://localhost:8001/v1`).

## Title Generation: SUCCESS
-   **Implementation:** The `generateTitleFromUserMessage` function in `freq-chat/app/(chat)/actions.ts` was modified to use a direct `fetch` call to the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (the proxy) with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenRouter key).
-   **Result:** With the corrected environment variables, title generation is **now working successfully**. Logs confirm requests are correctly routed through `http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions` to the `openrouter_proxy_mcp`, and titles are generated.

## Main Chat Streaming (`streamText` via Vercel AI SDK): REFACTORED
-   **Previous Issue:** The UI displayed "Please wait for the model to finish its response!" but no actual chat message content appeared, even though the `/api/chat` route returned 200 OK and proxy logs showed activity. The Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` (using `@ai-sdk/openai` provider) was suspected of not correctly using the custom `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for streaming, or there were issues with stream handling. Utilities like `OpenAIStream` or `StreamingTextResponse` could not be imported correctly from the `ai` package.
-   **Refactoring Applied (2025-05-31):**
    -   The `POST` handler in `freq-chat/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` was modified to bypass the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` and `myProvider.languageModel()` for the actual HTTP call.
    -   It now uses a direct `fetch` call to `process.env.OPENAI_BASE_URL + '/chat/completions'` with the `Authorization: Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`.
    -   The `fetchResponse.body` (a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`) is piped through `new TextDecoderStream()` to convert it to `ReadableStream<string>`.
    -   For non-resumable streams (if `streamContext` is null), the API now returns `new Response(responseStream, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream', ... } })`.
    -   For resumable streams, `streamContext.resumableStream(streamId, () => responseStream)` is used, and the result is wrapped in `new Response()`.
    -   The `onFinal` logic for saving messages to the database and logging to Mem0 has been **temporarily bypassed** during this refactoring to isolate and test the core streaming functionality.
-   **`openai.withOptions` Unavailability:** This documented method for explicit SDK configuration remains unavailable due to runtime errors (`TypeError: openai.withOptions is not a function`).

## Current Status (Post-Refactor)
-   Environment variables are correctly loaded by Freq-Chat when `pnpm dev` is run in a clean terminal.
-   Title generation (direct `fetch`) works correctly via the proxy.
-   Main chat streaming in `/api/chat` has been refactored to use direct `fetch` and standard `Response` objects with `text/event-stream` content type.
-   **Testing is now required to verify if this refactor has resolved the main chat streaming issue in the UI.**

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1.  **Test Freq-Chat Main Chat Streaming:**
    *   Run `freq-chat` using `pnpm dev` in a **clean terminal session**.
    *   Attempt to send messages in the chat UI.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Assistant's responses should now stream correctly into the UI.
    *   **Observe:**
        *   UI behavior.
        *   Browser console for errors.
        *   `openrouter_proxy_mcp` logs (should show requests for `/chat/completions`).
        *   `freq-chat` (Node.js) console logs (should show the "Environment Variables for direct fetch" logs).

2.  **If Streaming Works:**
    *   **Re-integrate `onFinal` Logic:** The logic for saving messages to the database and logging interactions to Mem0 (previously in `onFinal` or `streamText`'s `onFinish`) needs to be re-implemented. Since we are now dealing with a raw `ReadableStream` from `fetch`, this might involve:
        *   Using the `tee()` method on the `ReadableStream` to create two identical streams. One is sent to the client, and the other is consumed server-side to reconstruct the full message for saving/logging.
        *   Alternatively, investigate if a utility from the Vercel AI SDK (if a correct import can be found for the installed version) can wrap the raw stream and provide an `onComplete` or similar callback.
    *   This re-integration is crucial for data persistence and Mem0 logging.

3.  **If Streaming Still Fails:**
    *   Further debugging will be needed. Check:
        *   The exact structure of the `fetch` request body being sent to the proxy.
        *   The raw response from the proxy (if possible to intercept before it's wrapped in `new Response()`).
        *   Any errors logged by `openrouter_proxy_mcp` or `freq-chat` backend.
        *   Browser network tab for the `/api/chat` POST request: examine the response headers and raw response body/payload. Is `text/event-stream` being sent? Are there SSE chunks?

4.  **Address `preventDefault` UI Error:** Once backend streaming is confirmed working, re-evaluate and fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'preventDefault')` in `multimodal-input.tsx` if it still occurs.

5.  **Investigate Vercel AI SDK Import Issues:** Determine why `OpenAIStream` and `StreamingTextResponse` cannot be imported from `'ai'` with version `ai@4.3.13`. This might involve checking `node_modules`, `tsconfig.json`, or trying a clean install of `freq-chat` dependencies in a test environment. Resolving this could allow for a cleaner implementation using SDK utilities.

6.  **Investigate Cursor Terminal Environment:** Understand why Cursor's integrated terminal was overriding environment variables.

This refactoring is a significant step. Testing will confirm its success.
