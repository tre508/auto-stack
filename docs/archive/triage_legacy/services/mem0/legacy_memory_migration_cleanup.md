# Legacy Memory Migration & Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the stepwise process for migrating and cleaning up legacy memory data in mem0. The goal is to ensure data integrity, minimize downtime, and align all memory with the latest schema and retention policies.

---

## 1. Preparation & Backup

- **Inventory**: Identify all legacy memory tables, files, and formats in use.
- **Backup**: Create a full backup of all memory data (DB dumps, file copies). Store offsite if possible.
- **Freeze Writes**: Temporarily pause memory writes if feasible, or queue new writes for later replay.

---

## 2. Migration

- **Schema Review**: Compare legacy and new memory schemas. Document all differences.
- **Migration Script**: Write or update migration scripts to:
  - Transform legacy data to the new schema
  - Handle edge cases (missing fields, deprecated formats)
  - Log all changes for auditability
- **Dry Run**: Test migration on a copy of the data. Validate results.

---

## 3. Validation

- **Data Integrity**: Run checksums/hashes before and after migration.
- **Spot Check**: Manually review a sample of migrated records.
- **Automated Tests**: Run existing memory-related tests against the migrated data.

---

## 4. Cleanup

- **Legacy Data**: Archive or securely delete legacy memory data after successful migration and validation.
- **Schema Pruning**: Remove deprecated tables/fields from the database.
- **Codebase Update**: Remove or refactor code referencing legacy memory formats.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Rollback

- **Monitor**: Watch logs and metrics for anomalies post-migration.
- **Rollback Plan**: If issues arise, restore from backup and re-queue missed writes.

---

## 6. Documentation & Handover

- **Update Docs**: Ensure all memory documentation reflects the new schema and retention policies.
- **Handover**: Brief relevant team members on changes and new procedures.
