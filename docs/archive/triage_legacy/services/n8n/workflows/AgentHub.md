# AgentHubGuide: Multi-Agent Documentation & Task Orchestration Hub

**Goal:**  
Build a fully functional, modular, and scalable multi-agent system for documentation management, Freqtrade automation, and advanced workflow orchestration using n8n and MCP tools.

---

## Step 1: Foundation – Core Architecture

1. **Define Agent Roles & Workflows**
   - CentralBrain_Agent: Orchestrator and command dispatcher.
   - DocAgent_AutomationStack: Summarizes and indexes automation-stack docs.
   - DocAgent_FreqtradeUserData: Summarizes and indexes Freqtrade user docs.
   - FreqtradeSpecialist_Agent: Manages Freqtrade automations and sub-agents.
   - Sub-Agents: Strategist_Agent, DataAnalyst_Agent, LLM_RL_Specialist_Agent, MarketMonitor_Agent.

2. **Set Up CentralDocDatabase**
   - Choose a storage backend (vector DB, Supabase, Neon, or file system).
   - Ensure all agents can read/write summaries and indexes.

---

## Step 2: Integrate MCP Tools

1. **GitHub MCP Server**
   - Automate issue creation, status checks, and updates for documentation or trading events.
   - Use for logging agent actions or reporting errors.

2. **Supabase/Neon MCP Server**
   - Store and query structured data (summaries, agent logs, workflow results).
   - Use for analytics, state management, or as the CentralDocDatabase.

3. **Resend/Mailtrap MCP Server**
   - Send notifications, alerts, or reports (e.g., after doc processing or trade analysis).
   - Use Mailtrap for testing, Resend for production.

4. **Upstash MCP Server**
   - Implement caching for agent results, queueing for task distribution, or pub/sub for agent communication.

5. **Bucket MCP Server**
   - Manage feature flags for agent capabilities or rollout new workflow features dynamically.

---

## Step 3: Build Modular n8n Workflows

1. **CentralBrain_Agent Workflow**
   - Webhook trigger for commands.
   - NLP node (Vercel AI Chatbot) to parse natural language commands.
   - Switch node to route commands to sub-workflows.
   - HTTP Request nodes to trigger DocAgents, FreqtradeSpecialist_Agent, or MCP tools.
   - Success/error response formatting.

2. **DocAgent Workflows**
   - Triggered by CentralBrain_Agent.
   - Read and filter docs (use Execute Command or File nodes).
   - Summarize with LLM (Vercel AI Chatbot).
   - Store results in CentralDocDatabase (Supabase/Neon).
   - Optionally, create GitHub issues for doc changes or send notifications via Resend/Mailtrap.

3. **FreqtradeSpecialist_Agent & Sub-Agents**
   - Triggered by CentralBrain_Agent.
   - Run Freqtrade CLI commands (Execute Command node).
   - Parse and analyze results.
   - Store/report via Supabase/Neon, notify via Resend/Mailtrap, or log to GitHub.

---

## Step 4: Orchestration & Communication

1. **Use HTTP/Webhook Nodes for Inter-Agent Communication**
   - Each agent workflow exposes a webhook endpoint.
   - CentralBrain_Agent triggers sub-agents via HTTP Request nodes.

2. **Implement State & Status Reporting**
   - Agents report status/results back to CentralBrain_Agent (callback URL or DB update).
   - Use Upstash for distributed state or queueing if needed.

3. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Use GitHub MCP for error/issue logging.
   - Send alerts via Resend/Mailtrap on failures.

---

## Step 5: Advanced Features & Scaling

1. **Add Feature Flags (Bucket MCP)**
   - Dynamically enable/disable agent features or workflows.

2. **Implement Caching/Queueing (Upstash)**
   - Cache LLM results, queue heavy tasks, or implement pub/sub for agent events.

3. **Expand Agent Capabilities**
   - Add new sub-agents for additional domains (e.g., market monitoring, compliance).
   - Integrate more external APIs as needed.

4. **Monitor & Optimize**
   - Use n8n's built-in execution monitoring.
   - Scale n8n with queue mode and multiple workers for high throughput.

## Step 6: Integrate External Chat & Email Channels

1. **WhatsApp Integration**
   - Use n8n WhatsApp Cloud API node, Twilio WhatsApp, or a webhook from a WhatsApp bot service.
   - Trigger CentralBrain_Agent workflow on incoming WhatsApp messages.
   - Parse message content as agent command; route as normal.
   - Send agent response back to user via WhatsApp node.

2. **Email Integration**
   - Use n8n IMAP Email Trigger node to watch a dedicated inbox.
   - On new email, extract subject/body as agent command.
   - Trigger CentralBrain_Agent; process and aggregate result.
   - Send reply via n8n Email Send node.

3. **General Flow**
   - External user sends message (WhatsApp/email).
   - n8n receives, parses, and triggers agent workflow.
   - Agent system processes command, aggregates result.
   - n8n sends response back to user via original channel.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Restrict access to trusted users (whitelist numbers/emails).
   - Log all incoming/outgoing messages for audit.
   - Handle errors gracefully and notify user if command fails.
   - Document endpoints and update AgentHub as new channels are added.

## Summary Table: MCP Tools Integration

| Tool         | Integration Point                | Example Use Case                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GitHub MCP   | CentralBrain, DocAgent, Freqtrade| Issue tracking, error logging           |
| Supabase/Neon| CentralDocDatabase, all agents   | Data storage, analytics, state          |
| Resend       | All agents                       | Email notifications, alerts             |
| Mailtrap     | All agents (testing)             | Email testing                           |
| Upstash      | CentralBrain, all agents         | Caching, queueing, pub/sub              |
| Bucket       | CentralBrain, all agents         | Feature flags, remote config            |

## Best Practices

- **Keep workflows modular**: One agent per workflow, orchestrated by CentralBrain_Agent.
- **Use sub-workflows for each MCP tool**: Makes maintenance and scaling easier.
- **Monitor resource usage**: Large, monolithic workflows can hit memory limits—modularize and use queue mode for scaling.
- **Document endpoints and data flows**: Keep an up-to-date map of agent endpoints, webhook URLs, and data storage locations.
