# ðŸŽ¯ Master Game Plan

## 1. Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Development Environment

- âœ… Ubuntu Native Host Environment
- âœ… Docker Engine & Docker Compose
- âœ… VS Code with Dev Containers
- âœ… Git version control
- âœ… Python 3.10+ development environment

### 1.2 Service Architecture

- âœ… Controller service (FastAPI)
- âœ… Memory service (Mem0)
- âœ… n8n workflows
- âœ… Freqtrade integration
- âœ… OpenRouter proxy
- âœ… PostgreSQL database
- âœ… Qdrant vector store

## 2. Integration Points

### 2.1 Core Service Communication

- Controller â†” n8n webhook integration
- Controller â†” Mem0 memory management
- Controller â†” Freqtrade API
- n8n â†” OpenRouter for LLM access
- Shared volume mounts for file-based data exchange

### 2.2 Data Flow

- Centralized logging through Controller
- Memory persistence in Mem0
- Vector embeddings in Qdrant
- Trading data in PostgreSQL
- Configuration in environment files

## 3. Development Workflow

### 3.1 Local Development

1. Use VS Code Dev Containers for isolated environments
2. Follow the "Focused Workflow":
   - Open terminal
   - Navigate to specific service directory
   - Launch VS Code with `code .`
   - Use "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

### 3.2 Testing & Validation

- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests for service communication
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Manual verification checklist
